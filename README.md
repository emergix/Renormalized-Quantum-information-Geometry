# Renormalized Quantum Information Geometry

This document presents a novel synthesis between quantum field theory (QFT), optimal transport, and information geometry. It develops a renormalized version of quantum information geometry grounded in the language of functional gradients, relative entropy, and Wasserstein distances.

## Summary

### üìò Main Topics Covered:
- **Exact Renormalization Group (ERG):** Polchinski and Wetterich equations for scalar field theories.
- **Regulator Functions:** Definitions and typical choices for ERG flows.
- **Optimal Transport Connection:** Reformulating RG flows as Wasserstein gradient flows.
- **Relative Entropy & Monotonicity:** Viewing RG flow as a monotone decrease in relative entropy, giving rise to non-perturbative RG monotones.
- **Bregman Divergences & Path Integrals:** Interpreting path integrals as Bregman divergences, enabling a new perturbative approach.
- **Quantum Gravity:** Exploration of one-loop renormalization, non-renormalizability at two loops, and fourth-derivative gravity models.
- **Information Geometry:** Triangle relations for Bregman divergences and the geometric role of dual connections.
